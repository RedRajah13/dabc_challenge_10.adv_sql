Module 10 - Advanced SQL homework

In this challenge, I used the object relational mapper in SQLalchemy to analyze climate information from multiple weather stations in Hawaii over a course of 8 years. In the Jupyter notebook, I created dataframes and graphs visualizing precipitation levels over the last year for all stations as well as temperature readings for the station with the most temperature changes.

In the Flask API folder, you will find a database I created using the analysis from the climate_starter notebook. The database creates an interactive website where users can view different information from the climate data, and they can enter dates to see maximum, minimum, and average temperature observations for all the weather stations together.
